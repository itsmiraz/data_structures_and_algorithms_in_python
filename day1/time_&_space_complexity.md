# Time and Space Complexity

# Time complexity

Time complexity measures the running time of an algorithm as the the input size grows : 2 \* n (n is the input size)

# Big o notation

1. Always calculate tc in terms of worst cases
2. Avoid the constant values
3. Avoid lower bound

Different types of Time complexity

Big - On(o)
|
Worst Case
{upper bound}

theta(θ)
|
Average Case

Omega (ω)
|
Best Case

{lower bound}

<!--  Space complexity -->

= > Memory Space

Big o notation

Auxiliary Space : the extra space used to the solve the problem

- Input Space : the space used to store the input
